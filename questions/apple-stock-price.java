/*
Suppose we could access yesterday's stock prices as an array, where:

The values are the price in dollars of Apple stock.
A higher index indicates a later time.
So if the stock cost $500 at 10:30am and $550 at 11:00am, then:

stockPricesYesterday[60] = 500;

Write an efficient function that takes stockPricesYesterday and returns the best profit I could have made from 1 purchase and 1 sale of 1 Apple stock yesterday.

For example:

    int[] stockPricesYesterday = new int[]{10, 7, 5, 8, 11, 9};

    getMaxProfit(stockPricesYesterday);
    // returns 6 (buying for $5 and selling for $11)
    
    
No "shorting"â€”you must buy before you sell. You may not buy and sell in the same time step (at least 1 minute must pass).

Time - O(n)
Space - O(1)

public int getMaxProfit(int[] stockPricesYesterday) {

    // make sure we have at least 2 prices
    if (stockPricesYesterday.length < 2) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Getting a profit requires at least 2 prices");
    }

    // we'll greedily update minPrice and maxProfit, so we initialize
    // them to the first price and the first possible profit
    int minPrice = stockPricesYesterday[0];
    int maxProfit = stockPricesYesterday[1] - stockPricesYesterday[0];

    // start at the second (index 1) time
    // we can't sell at the first time, since we must buy first,
    // and we can't buy and sell at the same time!
    // if we started at index 0, we'd try to buy *and* sell at time 0.
    // this would give a profit of 0, which is a problem if our
    // maxProfit is supposed to be *negative*--we'd return 0!
    for (int i = 1; i < stockPricesYesterday.length; i++) {
        int currentPrice = stockPricesYesterday[i];

        // see what our profit would be if we bought at the
        // min price and sold at the current price
        int potentialProfit = currentPrice - minPrice;

        // update maxProfit if we can do better
        maxProfit = Math.max(maxProfit, potentialProfit);

        // update minPrice so it's always
        // the lowest price we've seen so far
        minPrice = Math.min(minPrice, currentPrice);
    }

    return maxProfit;
}
