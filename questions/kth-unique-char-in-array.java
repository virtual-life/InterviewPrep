/**
Time -  (O(n) and requires one traversal)

The idea is to use two auxiliary arrays of size 256 (Assuming that characters are stored using 8 bits). The two arrays are:

count[x] : Stores count of character 'x' in str.
           If x is not present, then it stores 0.

index[x] : Stores indexes of non-repeating characters
           in str. If a character 'x' is not  present
           or x is repeating, then it stores  a value
           that cannot be a valid index in str[]. For 
           example, length of string.
Initialize all values in count[] as 0 and all values in index[] as n where n is length of string.
Traverse the input string str and do following for every character c = str[i].
Increment count[x].
If count[x] is 1, then store index of x in index[x], i.e., index[x] = i
If count[x] is 2, then remove x from index[], i.e., index[x] = n
Now index[] has indexes of all non-repeating characters. Sort index[] in increasing order so that we get kâ€™th smallest element at index[k]. Note that this step takes O(1) time because there are only 256 elements in index[].
